# Timer

This project is an angular 5 Project, 

## Development server

To get this project running you have to run `npm install` in order to get the needed modules
then run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Development time

I spent 3 hours developing the front-end part of this project since I am more familiar to angularJs (1.5) than the newer
 versions. An other hour for testing and debugging of course.
