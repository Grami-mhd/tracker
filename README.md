## up and running

Since it is Symfony, there is no need to specify the needed commands to get it running,
just unzip it, run `php composer.phar install` to install the packages, create the database, I used`mysql`,
and then start the server, I am using `Apache`.

## time :

I did not use symfony for more than a year now, so it took me an hour to reinstall everything,
2 houres to learn how to develop Rest-APIs with symfony, I have never done it before, 
and an other two hours to develop and test my two web-services.

# Timer

This project is an angular 5 Project, 

## Development server

To get this project running you have to run `npm install` in order to get the needed modules
then run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Development time

I spent 3 hours developing the front-end part of this project since I am more familiar to angularJs (1.5) than the newer
 versions. An other hour for testing and debugging of course.
