## up and running

Since I used the wanted technology, Symfony, there is no need to specify the needed commands to get it running,
just unzip it, run `php composer.phar install` to install the packages, create the database, I used`mysql`,
and then start the server, I am using `Apache`.

## time :

I did not use symfony for more than a year now, so it took me an hour to reinstall everything,
2 houres to learn how to develop Rest-APIs with symfony, I have never done it before, 
and an other two hours to develop and test my two web-services.
